Utilize:
- **extract variables & constants**
- **replace loop with pipeline**: map, filter, reduce etc.
- **extract functions**
- **Introduce Parameter Object**: when a function needs to many parameters, create a type for them and pass them as an object; this can inspire domain concepts that were implicit
- **decouple conditional statements** into dedicated functions
- **move functions** across the class, to different files, utils etc. to ensure an appropriate place
